#Simplest MEAN Boilerplate

## Description

Simplest MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a simple starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) based applications. This project is inspired by [MEAN.JS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean).

I am developing this boilerplate as a hobbyist. This is not complete and should not be used in serious project. This boilerplate is for novice and beginners specially for those programmers who are new to world of web application development. As I am also new to Nodejs, Angularjs, Expressjs & MongoDB, therefore, I have tried to make such a boilerplate which is simplest and easiest of all available mean boilerplates. It doesn't demand you to be expert of all the MEAN technologies.

This boilerplate should be used for learning purpose. I repeat, please go for http://meanjs.org or http://mean.io if you need a boilerplate to kick start a serious application. This project is not following best practices which are being followed by the projects on the mentioned URLs.

## History

I used several tutorials on Nodejs, Angularjs and Expressjs to build one of my projects. When I finished my project, I realized that I can reuse much of the code in this project to kick start another project. Subsequently, I came to know about boilerplates. When I learnt what boilerplates are, I realized, I can also make one simple MEAN boilerplate from my current project code. Basically, this is the skeleton of my project code with, of course, logic code removed. Now I can use this to kick start any MEAN-based application. Hey!! I mean MEANS-based application, a real-time web application using socket.io

As I already told, that I am naive and a beginner, I would prefer this simple boilerplate for my projects until I am expert in MEAN technologies. When I think I have got enough experience, I would switch to mean.io or meanjs. These are maintained by professionals. Mine one is simpler so it is easier to learn and start with.

Sorry, for not using best practices as I am still learning. I would be improving this project over the time.

## Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed Node.js, MongoDB, NPM and Expressjs, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your Simplest MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

It will create a folder called node_modules. All the dependencies will be downloaded in this folder.

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application. Just type following in the command line:

```
$ node app.js
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
