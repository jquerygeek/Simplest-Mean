Description: 

I am developing this boilerplate as a hobbyist. This is not complete and should not be used in serious project. This boilerplate is for novice and beginners specially for those programmers who are new to world of web application development. As I am also new to Nodejs, Angularjs, Expressjs & MongoDB, therefore, I have tried to make such a boilerplate which is simplest and easiest of all available mean boilerplates. It doesn't demand you to be expert of all the MEAN technologies.

This boilerplate should be used for learning purpose. I repeat, please go for http://meanjs.org or http://mean.io if you need a boilerplate to kick start a serious application. This project is not following best practices which are being followed by the projects on the mentioned URLs.

History:

I used several tutorials on Nodejs, Angularjs and Expressjs to build my project. When I finished my project, I realized that I can reuse much of the code in this project to kick start another project. After this, I came to know about boilerplates. When I learnt what boilerplates are, I realized, I can also make one simplest MEAN boilerplate from my current project code. Basically, this is the skeleton of my project code with, of course, logic code removed. Now I can use this to kick start any MEAN-based application. Hey!! I mean a real-time web application using socket.io

As I already told, that I am naive and a beginner, I would prefer this simple boilerplate for my projects until I am expert in MEAN technologies. When I think I have got enough experience, I would switch to mean.io or meanjs. They have the way for you to how to write test code too.

Sorry, for not using best practices as I am still learning what the best practices are.
